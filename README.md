# Linked-list-in-C

This is a program for a linked list using C. 

This program let's the user	manipulate data in a list. 
The program first provides an empty list and has options
to insert an integer, delete an entry, search for an
integer, or print the entire list.

The program doesn't end until	the user exits.

This is an early implementation.
